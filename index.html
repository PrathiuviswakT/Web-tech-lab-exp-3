            <h2 >Campus life</h2>
        <p>
            Karunya is a residential University. Students are housed in thirteen different, well-furnished hostels with all the necessary facilities provided within the campus. Students need not look far for any amenity that they may require during their stay on campus. From a hospital to a bank, from dine-outs to utility stores, from Xerox shops to photo studios, you name it â€“ we have it on campus!
A capable hostel administration governs all the activities of the hostel residences; it consists of university staff that caters to the requests and necessities of the students. Each hostel has a minimum of 6 staff members who live with the students to guide and direct the students. Apart from the staff, each hostel also has a set of care-takers catering to the needs of the students, who can approached at any time of the day. Each hostel is also provided with security personnel who remain on guard round the clock. They all form a part of the hostel administration.

            <h2 >Cyber Security Knowledge Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The pioneering technologies of internet of things, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and data science have made our dependence on the cyber world irreversible. This dependency on the cyber world has opened new avenues for data breach and has made the cyber world vulnerable to crimes and attack. KITS has launched this new mission to secure cyber space and monitor potential attacks by adopting essential technologies in building and protecting systems using cyber security tools with required automation, machine learning and threat intelligence.
